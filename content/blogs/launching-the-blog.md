summary: "Hello!"

Hello! This is my first blog post. I'll be doing all sorts of writing here, so here's a brief overview. 

My current plan for the coming year is to read, and perhaps comment on, an economics paper every week. This will hopefully strengthen my ability to read papers and do research in general!

I want to write a bit about sectors I'm interested in--namely natural resources, industrials, defense and dual use tech, and biotech--and also a bit on economics, topics in applied mathematics, and of course, the books and essays I read!

I also want to read in other languages I am fluent in, namely French and German. I may write about those adventures as well. 

I might also publish these on my substack for ease of linking it.
