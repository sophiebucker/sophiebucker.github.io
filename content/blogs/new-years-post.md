Happy New Year! 

2025 was a wild year. I presented my first poster at a symposium in the physics dept, tried my hand at being a research assistant in various subfields of econ, and decided that I really want to go to grad school for economics. i did have some setbacks healthwise, but hopefully 2026 will be a lot better on that front.

A quick little goal I have is to read 50 books and 50 essays this year. I also want to read more in German and French, and dust off my Spanish.
